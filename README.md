# Attempts at disproving the Unfriendly Partition Conjecture

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unfriendly_partition

In this repo, I stored all my attempts at finding gadgets that could lead to a counterexample of the UPC.

There is also code for brute-finding a digraph that is not majority 3-colorable.

All graph files are sourced from [here](http://users.cecs.anu.edu.au/~bdm/data/digraphs.html).

## Concrete results:

- Every digraph of up to 7 vertices is majority 3-colorable.

- For every digraph G of up to 6 vertices and every two of its vertices u and v, there exists a majority 3-coloring of G s.t. u and v are colored differently.
